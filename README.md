## Features
 * A `nonest.basis()` function is provided that determines a basis for the null
   space of a matrix. This may be used in conjunction with `is.estble()` to
   determine the estimability (within a tolerance) of a given linear function of
   the regression coefficients in a linear model.
 * A set of `epredict()` methods are provided for `lm`, `glm`, and `mlm` objects.
   These work just like `predict()`, except an `NA` is returned for any cases that
   are not estimable. This is a useful alternative to the generic warning that
   "predictions from rank-deficient models are unreliable."
 * A function `estble.subspace()` that projects a set of linear functions onto an  
   estimable subspace (possibly of smaller dimension). This can be useful in
   creating a set of estimable contrasts for joint testing.
 * Package developers may wish to import this package and incorporate
   estimability checks for their `predict` methods.
